We can get a copy of any database with Backup and Restore commands in SQL Server Management Studio but there are a few tricks which makes our life easier.

First of all, it must be a full backup because a differential backup would be useless.

We can not restore a database to another one. If you just want to change the name of the database, you can easily give a new name at the restore process.
